# Sensitivity and Specificity in Machine Learning

## 1. Sensitivity (Recall or True Positive Rate)

Sensitivity measurses the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people correctly identified as having the condition).

$Sensitivity = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$

## 2. Specificity (True Negative Rate)

Specificity measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of healthy people correctly identified as not having the condition).

$Specificity = \frac{TN}{TN + FP}$
